# discord-covid
A discord bot which fetches data on current Covid-19 cases, deaths and recoveries from [Worldometers](https://worldometers.info) .

A simple but chaotic discord bot written in python. 
This was my first try on web scraping so it will have several problems.
Don't expect this to be updated.
